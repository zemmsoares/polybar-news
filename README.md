## Dependencies

- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) - python requests
- [zscroll](https://github.com/noctuid/zscroll#installation) - for **polybar** scroll *(optional)*
- [scroll](https://github.com/Anachron/i3blocks#scroll) - for **i3blocks** scroll *(optional)*


## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up a Python environment and install dependencies *(optional but recommended)*

```bash
# Create the environment
python -m venv /path/to/environment

# Activate the environment
source /path/to/environment/bin/activate

# Install the dependencies
pip install requests
```
##### Note: If you don't want to use a Python virtual environment, you can install the dependencies globally with pip install requests, but be aware this might conflict with other Python software on your system. <br><br>

3. Create a `config.py` file in the root of the project folder. You can use the following examples as a template depending on the news source you want to use.     

**For Hackernews:**
```python
news_source = "hackernews" 

# Number of news articles to fetch
number_news = 5
```
**For NewsAPI:**
```python
news_source = "newsapi" 

# Number of news articles to fetch
number_news = 5

# Register at NewsAPI.org to receive your API key.
api_key = "<your_api_key_here>" 

# Configure your desired news sources. 
# For available options, refer to NewsAPI.org/sources.

sources = "<your_desired_sources_here>"

# Configure your desired country. 
# Note: You can only filter either by sources or country. (leave one empty "")
country = "<your_desired_country_here>"  
```
